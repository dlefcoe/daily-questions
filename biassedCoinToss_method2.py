Assume you have access to a function toss_biased() which returns 0 or 1 with a probability that's not 50-50 (but also not 0-100 or 100-0).
You do not know the bias of the coin.

Write a function to simulate an unbiased coin toss.


solution taken from c++ code and converted to python
relies on fact that TF = FT
